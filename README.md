Project Build Instructions (for a subfolder labXX):

    Run CMake
    Set Source Folder to the "labs/labXX" directory
    Set Build Folder to a directory called "build", under "labs" (e.g. /your/path/labs/build)
    Run Configure, and just select default compilers, Visual Studio x64 should be the one that appears
    Run Generate
    Now, in the Build folder, you should see the solution file labXX.sln
